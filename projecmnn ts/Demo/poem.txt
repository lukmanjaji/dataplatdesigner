One day my teacher asked me to spell COURAGE

I said, ..W.O.M.A.N.....

She looked at me with so much astonishment...

She said again, spell LOVE

I said I said..W.O.M.A.N......that's it..

Then again she said...spell the word AFRICA

I said..W.O.M.A.N...

Then she asked me to spell TEARS, SMILE, PARADISE and more and more words

I gave the same answer...

She said you can't be serious...

The answer to every question can't be ..W.O.M.A.N...



Then I said..listen dear teacher...

Let's switch roles for a moment

And I wil tell you why

If you asked me a thousand questions

The answer will be same...



Then I heard a big bang of silence

Like the day our universe divorced herself

From a forced marriage to unknown platenory bodies

I said

Dear teacher..

Dear every being under the sound of my voice

What could be more courageous than

being a midwife..and

Delivering the earth of an overripe pregnancy with bear hands?

Bruised hands...

Spike torn feet...

Not deterred by the angry sun rays

Or the crying skies...

I ask...

Am I not right when I say love is a woman...

Love has a womb and ten fingers doing a million things

Love is me...I am Love



AFRICA is a woman...

Big and Strong...

But called WEAK by her cultures

AFRICA is my PARADISE but sometimes hell for the woman

Vast lands...beautiful landscape but can't own any because I'm a WOMAN

God created day and night for me...

But I cant work and walk freely in one of them...

Female Genital Mutilation? Let's not even go there...

Denied jobs sometimes because I'm told..

It's a man's world...



Listen audience...

It's 2016...

And my rights are tabled for discussions once again

A new dawn in my existence...

Let your discussions return my smiles

Let it take note of the memories of those who have burnt

And a solution to those still aflame...

In the name of

Moremi

Mathai

I say to men and women in the room.....

I am a girl

On the tough journey to womanhood

I am the solution you seek

The hope you’re looking for

I implore you to see the future

Through my eyes

Because I am the key…
